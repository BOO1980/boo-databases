    <h1>Database Overview</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A database is an organised collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system</li>
        <li>Computer requirements have increased to store larger volumes of data for fast retrieval</li>
        <li>Before the database system was invented, the flat file structure was commonly used to store data</li>
        <li>The flat file system consisted of fields and rows which are known as records</li>
        <li>When the number of rows/records in the data files increased to millions the system can become unmanageable</li>
        <li>In 1970s A Computer scientest invented the relational model for database management</li>
        <li>The relational model deals with issues caused by the flat file model. The data is now organised in entities and attributes</li>
